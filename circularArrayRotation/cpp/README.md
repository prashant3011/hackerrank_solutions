# Circular Array Rotation
###(in C++)

John Watson performs an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, `{ a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1] }`. 
After performing one right circular rotation operation, the array is transformed from `{ a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1] }` 
to `{ a[n-1], a[0], ..., a[n-2] }`.

Watson performs this operation `k` times. To test Sherlock's ability to identify the current element at a particular 
position in the rotated array, Watson asks `q` queries, where each query consists of a single integer, `m`, 
for which you must print the element at index `m` in the rotated array (i.e., the value of `a[m]`).

####Input Format

The first line contains space-separated integers, `n`, `k`, and `q`, respectively.
The second line contains space-separated integers, where each integer `i` describes array element` a[i]`
(where `0 <= i <= n`).
Each of the subsequent `q` lines contains a single integer denoting `m`.

####Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= a[i] <= 10^5
- 1 <= k <= 10^5
- 1 <= q <= 500
- 0 <= m <= N - 1

####Output Format

For each query, print the value of the element at index `m` of the rotated array on a new line.

#####Sample Input
```
3 2 3
1 2 3
0
1
2
```

#####Sample Output
```
2
3
1
```
####Explanation

After the first rotation, the array becomes `[3, 1, 2]`.
After the second (and final) rotation, the array becomes `[2, 3, 1]`.

Let's refer to the array's final state as array b. 
For each query, we just have to print the value of `b[m]` on a new line:

  1. `m = 0`, so we print `2` on a new line.
  2. `m = 1`, so we print `3` on a new line.
  3. `m = 2`, so we print `1` on a new line.
